Ongoing Multipath TCP deployments
=======================


1. Introduction


Explain briefly what is Multipath TCP and the benefits that it can bring


2. Faster failover on smartphones

As of this writing, there is only one significant deployment of Multipath
TCP where both the client and the server use Multipath TCP : Siri

Explain the Siri usage and some lessons learned from this deployment

*one figure showing the end-to-end connection*

3. Bandwidth aggregation on smartphones

Explain the motivations for the KT deployment and some of  the
lessons learned

*one figure showing smartphone, WiFi+LTE, SOCKS server, and final server* 

4. Bandwidth Aggregation in Access Networks

4.1 Heterogeneous access networks 

Explain the OVH deployment and some of the lessons learned from this deployment

* one figure showing client, OverTheBox device, chaining of access routers, SOCKS server and final server*

4.2 Hybrid access networks
